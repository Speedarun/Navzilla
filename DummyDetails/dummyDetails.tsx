    description: "To make a classic cappuccino, start by brewing a single or double shot of espresso using an espresso machine. Meanwhile, steam milk until it becomes velvety and frothy, ensuring you achieve a thick foam layer. Once the espresso is ready, pour the steamed milk over it, holding back the foam with a spoon. Finally, spoon the foam on top, creating a perfect balance of espresso, milk, and foam. You can sprinkle cocoa powder or cinnamon for extra flavor.",

    description: "A macchiato is a simple yet bold coffee drink. Begin by pulling a single or double shot of espresso into a cup. In a separate container, steam a small amount of milk until it reaches a smooth, velvety texture. Carefully spoon a dollop of the frothed milk onto the espresso, just enough to ‘mark’ it with a creamy touch. This drink maintains the strong flavor of espresso while adding a hint of creaminess. For a sweeter version, caramel can be drizzled on top.",

    description: "A latte is a creamy, smooth coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. Start by brewing a shot of espresso in a large cup. Next, steam milk until it becomes silky and smooth, creating microfoam. Slowly pour the steamed milk into the espresso, allowing the two to blend naturally while keeping a thin layer of foam on top. You can enhance the latte with flavored syrups such as vanilla or caramel. Latte art can also be created by skillfully pouring the milk into the espresso.",

    description: "An Americano is a simple yet robust coffee drink. Start by brewing a single or double shot of espresso. In a separate cup, pour hot water, approximately twice the amount of the espresso. Then, carefully pour the espresso into the hot water to maintain the crema on top. The result is a smooth and rich coffee with a milder intensity than a straight espresso. Some variations allow for adding milk or sugar, depending on personal preference.",

Begin by pulling a shot of espresso and mixing it with a tablespoon of chocolate syrup or cocoa powder. Steam milk until it becomes smooth and creamy, then pour it over the espresso-chocolate mixture while stirring gently. Top with whipped cream and an extra drizzle of chocolate syrup for an indulgent finish. Some versions also include a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg for added depth of flavor.",

    description: "A flat white is a strong and creamy espresso-based drink. Begin by pulling a double shot of espresso into a small cup. Steam the milk until it becomes smooth and velvety, creating microfoam. Unlike a latte, the milk in a flat white is more integrated with the espresso, producing a richer texture. Slowly pour the milk into the espresso while maintaining a consistent pour, ensuring a smooth and balanced taste. This drink is known for its strong coffee flavor with a silky mouthfeel.",

Let the mixture steep in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours. Once steeped, strain the coffee through a fine-mesh filter or cheesecloth to remove the grounds. Serve the concentrate over ice and dilute with water or milk as desired. Cold brew is naturally sweeter and less acidic than regular iced coffee.",

Start by preparing a standard cold brew by steeping coarsely ground coffee in cold water for 12 to 24 hours. Once filtered, transfer the cold brew to a nitro keg and infuse it with nitrogen using a high-pressure system. The nitrogen creates tiny bubbles, giving the drink a smooth, foamy texture. Serve it straight from a tap for the best cascading effect, similar to a stout beer.",
